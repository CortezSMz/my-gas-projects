# [Data Studio Calendar Visualization](#data-studio-calendar-visualization)

Working Calendar Scheduler Visualization using [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/overview).

I've created this because I needed a very simple to manage, free and intuitive way to schedule car rides on my current job.

## [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)

1. Users can schedule a car ride on this [Google Forms](https://datastudio.google.com/s/oaJDWGWr0zw) included in the visualization, which then goes to [this sheet](https://i.imgur.com/w0U7jc6.png).

2. When Confirmed, the schedule data is copied to this [Calendar Sheet](https://i.imgur.com/w3gWAVl.png), that includes all dates in the calendar in a range.

3. Google Data Studio then fetchs and display the information nicely, with a bunch of filters and styles.
